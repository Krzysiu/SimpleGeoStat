# SimpleGeoStat
Simple script which takes input data (country, city, state) and:

1. convert it to coordinates, which may be then reused on the map; 
2. generates country/continent statistics

The purpose is to make such statistics for fun - e.g. social services polls etc. 

Remember, such statistics are for fun, it's not scientific.
